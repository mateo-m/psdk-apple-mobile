# Prove that a key press reaches a released PSDK game.
#
# LiteRGSS hands the key-pressed event to a Ruby proc. Upstream commit
# f582db8 put the scancode in front of the flags, and a game built before
# that commit registers a proc of two parameters, so the scancode lands
# where "alt is down" belongs. A scancode is never nil, so every key read
# as Alt, and PSDK answers Alt+Enter with Graphics.swap_fullscreen. The
# confirm key changed the video mode and set no key at all.
#
# DisplayWindowInput.cpp reads the proc's arity and sends the shape that
# proc asks for. This check drives the real game and reads what PSDK
# holds down, which is the answer the game itself reads.
#
# Usage: check-key-arity-ios.sh --game <dir> [--ruby 2.5] [--device <udid>]
# Prerequisite: tools/test-host/build-test-host-ios.sh --ruby <version>
