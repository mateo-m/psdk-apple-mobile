# Install PsdkTests.app on a booted simulator, put a game in its data
# container, and run it.
#
# The game folder stays out of the app bundle. A released PSDK game is
# hundreds of megabytes, and the game writes next to its own files, so it
# goes into Documents, which is writable.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/test-host/run-test-host-ios.sh --game <dir> [--seconds 90]
#                                       [--snap-every 5] [--device <udid>]
#                                       [--keys 50:36,56:2] [--rotate 60:4]
#                                       [--fast-forward 4] [--ruby 2.5]
#
# --keys presses keys, by USB HID usage, at the given second, to drive
# the game without a person at the keyboard. host.m explains the format.
#
# --ruby picks the host that build-test-host-ios.sh built for that Ruby:
# 2.5, 3.0 (the default), 3.2 or 3.3. It must match the version in the
# game's Game.yarb.
#
# The snapshots come from `simctl io screenshot`, not from the game. A
# picture of the display proves the frame was presented. A picture the
# game draws for itself only proves it rendered.
#
# Prerequisite: tools/test-host/build-test-host-ios.sh --ruby <version>
