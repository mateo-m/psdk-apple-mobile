# Checks SFML's WAV reader against every sample format it claims to read.
#
# Builds the reader for the Mac, not for iOS. The reader has no platform
# code, so the same source file answers the same way in both places, and a
# Mac build turns a change around in a second instead of a full simulator
# run. The end-to-end run in run-test-host-ios.sh is what proves the sound
# reaches the device.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/test-host/test-wav-formats.sh [path/to/reference.wav]
#
# With a reference file, the test also decodes it with Apple's afconvert and
# compares the two sample by sample. Edelweiss Chronicles' title music is a
# good one:
#   .../Edelweiss_Chronicles_EN/app/audio/bgm/opening mix master 2.wav
