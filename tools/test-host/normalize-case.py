"""Rename loose game files to the spelling the game's scripts use.

iOS opens files case-sensitively. Windows and macOS do not, so a released
PSDK game can ship Yuki_Transition_Circular.txt and ask for
yuki_transition_circular.txt. Edelweiss Chronicles does that for two
shader files.

A second name under the other spelling is not an option. The staging
volume on a Mac is case-insensitive, so both names are the same file
there and the link or copy fails. A rename works on both volumes,
because APFS accepts a case-only rename.

The spelling to use comes from the game itself. Data/Scripts.dat holds
the compiled scripts, and every path literal survives in the bytecode as
a plain string. This reads those literals and renames the file on disk
when a literal points to it through a different spelling.

A host must do the same before it runs a game. run-test-host-ios.sh
calls this script.

Usage: normalize-case.py <game-dir>
