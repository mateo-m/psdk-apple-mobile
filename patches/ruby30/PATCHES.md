# Ruby 3.0: patches

Psdk30Core, the core for Pokémon SDK (PSDK) games compiled on Windows, uses
Ruby 3.0. This folder holds the patches of that Ruby.

## `load-i386-bytecode.patch`

- **Applies to**: Ruby 3.0.7, `compile.c`.
- **Problem**: a released PSDK game ships its scripts as bytecode in `Game.yarb`
  and `Data/Scripts.dat`. PSDK compiles them with a 32-bit Windows Ruby 3.0
  (`i386-mingw32`). `RubyVM::InstructionSequence.load_from_binary` raises
  `unmatched platform` on any other platform.
- **Change**: when the platform string in the file starts with `i386-` or
  `i686-`, the loader reads the 32-bit layout. When it names 64-bit Linux or
  macOS (`x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin`, `arm64-darwin`), the
  loader reads the file as it is, because that layout is the layout of iOS.
  Before Pokémon Studio, a developer could compile a game by hand on Linux or
  a Mac with Ruby 3.0. 64-bit Windows (`x64-mingw`) stays refused: its `long`
  has 32 bits.

The 32-bit layout differs from the 64-bit layout in these places:

| Data | 32-bit file | Patch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Numbers in the compact format | 32 bits, negative values not extended | Sign-extends from 32 bits |
| `true`, `nil`, `undef` | 2, 4, 6 | Maps to the 64-bit values |
| Optional argument table, local table, keyword table | 4-byte entries | Reads 4-byte entries |
| Keyword struct | 4-byte pointers | Reads the 32-bit struct |
| Range, encoding, Complex, Rational | 4-byte `long` | Reads 4-byte `long` |
| Bignum | 4-byte length, 32-bit digits | Unpacks 32-bit digits |
| Float | `double` aligned to 8 (Windows) or 4 (Linux) | Picks the alignment from the platform string |

The Ruby version check stays. Bytecode from Ruby 3.1 or later does not load.

### Two Ruby 3.0 layouts

Ruby 3.0.3 added one field (`outer_variables`) to each compiled method and kept
the format version. Games made with Ruby 3.0.0 to 3.0.2 do not have the field.
Edelweiss Chronicles uses Ruby 3.0.1. The PSDK binaries of 2026 use Ruby 3.0.6.

The header does not tell the two layouts apart. The patch reads the last
compiled method with each field count. Only the correct count ends at the zero
padding before the offset list. If no count fits, the loader raises an error.

`tools/psdk-bytecode-check/` has the test and its result.
