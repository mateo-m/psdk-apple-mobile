# PSDK paces the game with Graphics::FPSBalancer. The balancer divides
# the real clock by 1000000 / Graphics.frame_rate, and it runs that many
# game frames. So the frame rate that the balancer reads is the only way
# to make the game go faster. The window keeps its own draw limit, and the
# balancer reads Graphics.frame_rate on each update, so a change applies
# while the game runs.
#
# PSDK defines the reader with attr_accessor, later than this file. This
# module opens Graphics first and waits for that definition, because a
# game loads its scripts from compiled bytecode, and bytecode carries no
# trace instructions, so TracePoint never reports the end of the body.

# PSDK keeps one typed string: `Input.on_text_entered` assigns it, and

# a paste, and every character of it lands between two game frames. Add
# the characters instead of replacing them. `GamePlay::NameInput` reads
# the value with `text.chars`, so it takes a longer string.
